            Keep your “Me in 30 Seconds” statement brief. People generally listen effectively only 30 to 60 seconds, and they appreciate concise responses to questions. This indicates that you are clearly focused and waste no time     getting to the point.
            </p>
            <ul class="aboutme-article-content">
              <li>Speak in the present tense to show that your skills are current and applicable in today’s market.</li>
              <li>Remember your audience. Adjust the level of detail and industry jargon you use according to the interest and experience of the person you are addressing.</li>
              <li>Avoid common claims such as: “I’m trustworthy, loyal, helpful, courteous, kind,” and so on. Not only are these claims made by most job seekers, but without detailed examples, they don’t convey your value to a potential employer.</li>
              <li>Make your “Me in 30 Seconds” statement natural. It is a genuine form of communication that will help you organize everything you are into brief, coherent thoughts. </li>
